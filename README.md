# School_District_Analysis

The purpose of our analysis is to find the overall passing percentages of the students and see if there is any correlation with the budget per student. What we have found is that some of the test scores from the 9th grade at Thomas High School are missing. Since these values are missing we want to take all of the scores from the high school so that it doesn't affect our overall numbers.

After taking a look at both district summaries from pycityschools and pycityschools_challenge there is not a change.

#How is the school summary affected?

Thomas High school now has a .3 lower over all passing percentage compared to when we had the 9th grade values included in our data.
